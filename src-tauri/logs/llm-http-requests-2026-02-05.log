[2026-02-05 09:10:28.658 UTC] [SYSTEM REQUEST] [Session: ac855cc9-f648-42e6-9f11-5c20398e3db6] [Conversation: 4f5f6887-9cda-4db1-bace-54e4a7dac160] [Provider: moonshot] [Model: kimi-k2.5]

[SystemContext: Current Execution ID is '4f5f6887-9cda-4db1-bace-54e4a7dac160'. Use this for todos tool calls.]

[TaskMainlineSummary]
任务主线摘要:
- 当前任务: 今天几号了
- 约束: 只围绕当前任务推进，避免无关操作。

[RunState]
Task Brief: 今天几号了
Selected Tools: http_request

[Execution Environment]
- Environment: docker
- OS: linux
- Working Directory: /workspace/context

[Working Directory Note: When performing file operations, executing scripts, or any file system related tasks, use this directory as your base path unless explicitly specified otherwise by the user.]

[Context Storage]
- Environment: docker (linux)
- Execution ID: 4f5f6887-9cda-4db1-bace-54e4a7dac160
- All large tool outputs are stored at '/workspace/context'
- Tool outputs exceeding threshold are saved as files (not truncated)
- Applies to: shell commands, HTTP responses, and other tools
- Your conversation history is at '/workspace/context/history_4f5f6887-9cd.txt' (isolated per execution)

Examples:
• ls -lh "/workspace/context"  (list all stored files)
• grep -ri "pattern" "/workspace/context"/*.txt  (search for pattern)
• tail -n 100 "/workspace/context"/http_response_*.txt  (view HTTP output)
• cat "/workspace/context"/history.txt  (view conversation history)

All files are centralized in one directory for easy management and search.
Note: Each execution has its own history file to prevent cross-session data leakage.
